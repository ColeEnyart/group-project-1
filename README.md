# Which Star Wars character are you?

## Link to Deployed Page
[Star Wars character website](https://coleenyart.github.io/which-star-wars-character-are-you/)

## Objective
In this project, we created a website using Star Wars API (SWAPI) that allows users to complete a quiz about themselves and find out which Star Wars character they are. Once they finish the quiz, we also include a seperate encyclopedia page using Grid.js where users can search for all other Star Wars characters from the API. 

## Team Members
